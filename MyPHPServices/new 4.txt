SAP is the largest enterprise software provider in the world. SAP ECC is used by Some of the world`s largest organizations. Most of the ECC applications are written in ABAP and generally run on SAP GUI. SAP has tried few other UI technologies such as webdynpro for its web-applications but had limited success.

SAP Fiori is SAP`s latest UI stretagy for its future applications. It is based on SAPUI5.

For a front-end developer who is already working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and XML etc, it`s just another Javascript library.

Challenges for Abapers...(?)
There are few differences between ABAP and SAPUI5 development. Abapers are generally very much habitual of using inbuilt capabilities of SAP GUI and ABAP AS(application server). Such as ALV`s, versioning, debugger, no separate handling of source code file  etc. But that is not the case with SAPUI5 development. Here you have to take care of various files generated in course of development. 
Unlike ABAP editor there are many proprietary and SAP provided tools, available for SAPUI5 development. It can be started even with a text editor.

Conceptually SAPUI5 development follows MVC paradigm. Where as classical ABAP doesn`t necessarily follow it.

SAPUI5 applications are independent of backend systems. They can consume data using web-services from various systems. In an SAP environment they consume data from ODATA services created using SAP Gateway. 

One of the most common challenge in my experience is to get access to a demo SAP system with SAP Gateway. Sometimes the SAP Gatway installation itself is missing or the authorizations are missing due your organizations policies.

Due to these challenges it becomes difficult to stay motivated.This is my attempt to help beginners, right from setting up basic development environment, to creating working applications.

In the next post, we will discuss the basic system architecture of SAPUI5 applications and begin with setting up development environment.
